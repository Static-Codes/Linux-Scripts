# Emulating ARM32 (ARMv7) on x86-64

This script is for a Debian based distro, it can be easily adapted for Fedora based and/or Arch!

# Note:

The process of emulating another instruction set is extremely CPU intensive.
Even with enterprise grade hardware, your experience will be subpar when compared to native hardware.

If you run into any issues, please run `sh ./unmt.sh`

1. Run `sh ./download.sh`

2. Run `sh ./extract.sh`

3. Run `sh ./install.sh`

4. Run `sh ./run-text.sh`
